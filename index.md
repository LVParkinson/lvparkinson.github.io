## Welcome to my site!
As you can probably tell, it is under construction. So for now, you can read about how Markdown works. No reason to take it away until I figure out how to format what I'm replacing it with.

I am currently creating a machine learning program for the ETH-UZH Herbarium as part of my final project with Propulsion Academy Zurich. The program will be able to classify specimens as reproductive (with fruits or flowers) or non-reproductive. This is to speed up phenology studies (the timing of natural events) across Switzerland.  








## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LVParkinson/LVParkinson.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.






### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LVParkinson/LVParkinson.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
