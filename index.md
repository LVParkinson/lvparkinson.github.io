## Welcome
As you can probably tell, this site is under construction. 

#About Me
I am a forest ecologist studying data science. I want to build tools so ecologists can work faster and the public can understand ecology better. 

I am currently creating a machine learning program for the ETH-UZH Herbarium as part of my final project with Propulsion Academy Zurich. The program will classify herbarium specimens as reproductive (with fruits or flowers) or non-reproductive. This will speed up phenology studies (the timing of natural events) across Switzerland.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/LVParkinson/LVParkinson.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LVParkinson/LVParkinson.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
