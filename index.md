## Welcome
As you can probably tell, this site is under construction. 

### About Me
I am a forest ecologist studying data science. I want to build tools so ecologists can work faster and the public can understand ecology better. 

I am currently creating a machine learning program for the ETH-UZH Herbarium as part of my final project with Propulsion Academy Zurich. The program will classify herbarium specimens as reproductive (with fruits or flowers) or non-reproductive. This will speed up phenology studies (the timing of natural events) across Switzerland.
